# Building srcML

srcML is built using cmake, www.cmake.org, (version 2.8.12 or above) and currently supports builds for OS X, Fedora, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and Windows Visual Studio.

In source (builds within the source directory) are recommended, however and out of source builds (builds outside the source directory) are supported.

---

## Unix

* To generate a makefile in the current directory run, for out of source builds:

    `cmake <path_to_srcml>`

* For in source builds, use:

    `cmake .`

* The following make commands are supported with their usual meaning

	`make`  
	`make clean`  
 	`make tests`  

### Unix Distribution Specifics

#### OSX

##### Packages Required

* antlr2
* boost
* cmake

For srcML documentation generation:

* man2html
* ronn

Additional packages that may not needed, but are recommended (for timing etc.):

* coreutils
* gnu-sed
* gnu-time

Distribution of dmg/pkg:

* PackageMaker

##### Notes

* OS X does not install header files for libarchive. You can download these from Apple's:

    * [archive.h](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/libarchive/libarchive-30/libarchive/libarchive/archive.h?txt)
    * [archive_entry.h](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/libarchive/libarchive-30/libarchive/libarchive/archive_entry.h?txt)

* PackageMaker is currently being used. However, it is deprecated and no longer available. A conversion to pkgbuild is in progress

#### Fedora

##### Required Packages

* gcc
* gcc-c++
* antlr
* libxml2-devel
* libxslt-devel
* cmake
* libarchive-devel
* boost-devel
* boost
* libcurl-devel
* openssl-devel
* antlr-C++

srcML documentation generation

* man2html
* ronn

rpm generation

* @development-tools
* fedora-packager

for mingw cross compilation for Windows

* dos2unix
* mingw32-gcc-c++
* mingw32-antlr
* mingw32-libarchive
* mingw32-libxml2
* mingw32-libxslt
* mingw32-boost-static
* mingw32-pthreads
* mingw32-libgnurx
* mingw32-curl
* mingw32-openssl
* mingw32-nsis

##### Notes

* Fedora and Windows cross compiling require:

First fnmatch.h needs copied over into mingw includes (something like):

    `cp /usr/include/fnmatch.h /usr/i686-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/include/`

To actually run the compiled srcML, the dlls provided by mingw will
need to be copied along with the source to the intended Windows
machine.

#### openSUSE

##### Required Packages

* gcc
* gcc-c++
* antlr
* antlr-devel
* libxml2-devel
* libxslt-devel
* libxslt-tools
* libarchive-devel
* libcurl-devel
* libopenssl-devel

srcML documentation generation*

* ronn

##### Notes

* See 64-bit Linux for installing boost.

* Building srcML requires a version of cmake greater that what is
typically supported. Visit http://www.cmake.org to download and
install the lastest version of cmake.

* There is no man2html package on OpenSUSE for srcML documentation
generation. The url is:

	`http://www.oit.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/tar/man2html3.0.1.tar.gz`

* Use the following to install as ./install.me does not appear to use
the right location

	perl install.me

* libantlr was not compiled with -fPIC for 64-bit (at least for 13.2). To do so,
change line 59 of scripts/cxx.sh.in to `cxxflags="-felide-constructors -pipe -fPIC"`.
You will also need to fix the compilation of lib/cpp/antlr/CharScanner.hpp by adding
`#include <strings.h>` and replacing EOF in line 475 to 1.Then you can build using
```./configure``` and ```make``` do not make install as you need the distributed antlr.
Instead, copy lib/cpp/src/libantlr.a to /usr/local/lib64/.

#### Ubuntu (and Linux Mint)

##### Required Packages

* gcc
* g++
* libxml2-dev
* libxslt1-dev
* libarchive-dev
* antlr
* libantlr-dev
* libcurl4-openssl-dev
* libssl-dev

For srcML documentation generation:

* man2html
* ronn

##### Notes

* Ubuntu versions before 14.04 (possibly before 13) do not
provide a recent enough version of cmake. Visit http://www.cmake.org
to download and install the lastest version of cmake.

* boost also needs to be installed separately, see 64-bit Linux.


#### 64-bit Linux

##### Notes

* The boost libraries are statically compiled in, 64-bit machines do not provide adequate libraries for static compilation (require compilation with -fPIC). Download boost at http://www.boost.org. The commands to build boost (written for boost 1.55.0) are:

	`./bootstrap.sh --without-libraries=atomic,chrono,context,coroutine,exception,graph,graph_parallel,iostreams,locale,log,math,mpi,python,random,serialization,signals,test,timer,wave`
	
	
	`./b2 link=static cxxflags="-fPIC -static -Wl,--whole-archive" threading=multi install`

---

## Windows Visual Studio
 
Installing for Windows Visual Studio requires a large amount of
preparation.
	
## Packages Required

* cmake from `http://www.cmake.org`

GNU command line utilities (from cygwin or other sources):

* grep
* sed

Required libraries (most are available from http://xmlsoft.org/sources/win32/):

* iconv
* libxml2
* libxslt
* zlib
* libcurl http://curl.haxx.se/download.html
* antlr 2 http://www.antlr2.org/download/antlr-2.7.7.msi and http://www.antlr2.org/download/antlr-2.7.7.tar.gz
* boost

##### Notes

* For the required libraries, you will need to create a folder dep
in the top level directory of srcML project with the following structure:

	dep/
 		include/
		bin/
		lib/

* Copy the contents of the required libraries into the correct
location.If the include files are in a directory, copy the entire directory, e.g., copy the entire libxml
subdirectory.Note: There may be some runtime problems with these
libraries and the ones installed on your Windows machine. In which
case, a Windows Visual Studio build of each may be required.

* For libcurl make sure to git one of the MVSC builds.Version 7.19.3
devel with CSS seems to support compilation.

* For antlr 2 you will need the installer and the source code.The .lib
file provided with antlr 2 does not seem to work.So, a Windows
Visual Studio build will need to be done to generate a correct copy of
the .lib.When cmake is configuring the project, it will ask for the
correct location of antlr and the library.Note: Create a empty
project in Visual Studio, set it to generate a static library and turn
of clr, and add all the source from (lib/antlr/cpp/src) to "Source
Files".Then, set lib/antlr/cpp/antlr as an include directory.

* boost will need to be compiled.The zip file is large, and can take a
large amount of time on Windows.Then, run:

	./bootstrap.bat

This will create a project-config.jam file copy the following contents
replacing everything (Using boostrap.sh to configure does not seem to
work correctly on Windows):

	import option;

	using msvc

	libraries =--without-atomic --without-chrono --without-context --without-coroutine --without-exception --without-graph --without-graph_parallel --without-iostreams --without-locale --without-log --without-math --without-mpi --without-python --without-random --without-serialization --without-signals --without-test --without-timer --without-wave ;

	option.set keep-going : false ; 

Then, run:

 	./b2.exe link=static threading=multi

Currently, cmake uses an environment variable for the location of
boost.Create/set an envionment variable `BOOST_ROOT` to have the
path to the boost source.
