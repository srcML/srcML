 * This file is part of the srcML Toolkit.
 *
 * Adds stream parsing capabilities to a Parser class.
 *
 * Fundamentally it provides a nextToken method so that another Parser
 * can use this as a TokenStream.
 *
 * A new class is created with the template parameter Base and
 * TokenStream as base classes.  This allows other Parsers to use it as
 * a TokenStream in their constructor.
 *
 * It also implements the TokenStream nextToken method and provides
 * pushToken methods to fill the token buffer.
 *
 * Parser grammars that use this class must also inherit from TokenParser.hpp
