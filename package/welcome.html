<p>This installer contains packages that allow you to work efficiently with the srcML format:</p>

<ul>
<li>Convert source code to srcML, whether it's a single file, entire project, code fragment, or individual statement</li>
<li>Convert srcML back to source code without losing whitespace or formatting</li>
<li>Perform queries on source code using XPath and RelaxNG</li>
<li>Perform transformations on source code using XSLT</li>
</ul>

<br/>

<p>By default, the srcML command-line client package is installed. You also have the option to install the libsrcml development and example packages, which will enable you to integrate srcML features into your application.</p>

<p>For further details, visit <a href="https://www.srcML.org">srcML.org</a></p>
