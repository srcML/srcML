# Docker

Docker images are used to build, package, and test srcML on Linux. A Docker Compose file, `compose.yml`, is in the root directory and manages docker image management (build, push, pull) and execution on all the Linux distributions for packaging. The Dockerfiles are in the directory `docker` with a subdirectory for each platform.

All docker-compose commands are entered in the root directory of the srcML repository. They do not work in the docker subdirectory or the build directory.

## Build and Package srcML on Linux

The default operation is running the workflow `ci-<platform>`, which includes building, packaging, and testing the installed package. By default, it runs the cmake workflow `ci-package-<installer>` where the <installer> is `deb` or `rpm`. I.e., for Ubuntu, it is equivalent to running the following:

```console
cmake --workflow --preset ci-ubuntu
```

To build and package srcML on all supported Linux distributions:

```console
docker compose up
```

All packages are saved to the docker volume `srcml_dist`. The Docker Desktop lets you view the volume's contents and download individual packages.

There is a lot of control to only build and package for specific distributions or platforms. To build and package srcML on Ubuntu 24.04

```console
docker compose up ubuntu_24.04
```

To build and package srcML for all Ubuntu distributions:

```console
docker compose --profile ubuntu up
```

All Linux services are organized into Docker Compose profiles. They include a default profile, e.g., `package`; Linux distributions, e.g., `ubuntu`, `fedora`, and `opensuse`, and age, e.g., `latest`, `earliest`.

## Architecture

The default architecture is your host machine's architecture, i.e., `linux/amd64` or `linux/arm64`. To
build on the non-default architecture, set the environment variable `PLATFORM`. E.g., To build for x86 while on  an ARM architecture, you can set the environment variable:

```console
export PLATFORM="linux/amd64"
```

Or, you can run the command with the environment set:

```console
env PLATFORM="linux/amd64" docker compose up
```

## Mangage Packages

There are some special services to manage the packages.

To list the built packages:

```console
docker compose run ls
```

To combine all packages into one archive file:

```console
docker compose run tar
```

To remove all generated packages:

```console
docker compose run clean
```

## Maintain Docker Images

The following commands apply to all Docker images. To selectively do any of the following, see the variations above.

Docker images are automatically pulled when they are not in the local cache. If they are in the local cache, they are **not** automatically updated. To update docker images:

```console
docker compose pull
```

If the Dockerfiles change, a new one is added, or a previous one is updated, the image needs to be rebuilt. To build all docker images (after Dockerfile change):

```console
docker compose build
```

To push all docker images to Docker Hub (if you have permission):

```console
docker compose push
```
